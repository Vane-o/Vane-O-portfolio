Terminal and Bash challenge

In this activity we were tasked to collect data using Linux OS through a virtual machine. The activity is called Lucky Duck Roullete, where we needed to manage our way in Linux OS looking for information about the roullete.

We were asked to look for the players with more log ins, player time log ins, money won by players, and more. The main task is to assess our knowledge in Bash language since we needed to find the data in Linux.
