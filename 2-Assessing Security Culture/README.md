Assessing Security Culture

Assessing Security is one of the core priorities of Cybersecurity. In this activity we we're asked to assess and read risks and possible outcomes in workplace security.

We we're given situations that we needed to judge, what possible problems could happen, what possible outcomes for the problems, what solutions to impose, and any applicable cybersecurity actions in each situation.
